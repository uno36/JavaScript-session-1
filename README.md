## Variable Declaration

### What I Learned
- How to declare and assign values to variables.
- The importance of using meaningful variable names.

### Exercises
1. Declared a variable `name` and assigned my name to it.
2. Declared a variable `age` and assigned my age to it.
3. Declared a variable `isStudent` and assigned a boolean value to it indicating whether I am a student.
4. Printed all three variables.

## Variable Reassignment

### What I Learned
- How to reassign values to variables after their initial declaration.

### Exercises
1. Declared a variable `favoriteColour` and assigned my favorite color to it.
2. Printed the value of `favoriteColour`.
3. Reassigned `favoriteColour` to a different color.
4. Printed the new value of `favoriteColour`.

### File

## Arithmetic Operations

### What I Learned
- Performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Exercises
1. Declared two variables `num1` and `num2` and assigned them values.
2. Calculated the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `num1` and `num2`.
3. Printed the results of these arithmetic operations.

## Data Types and Operators

### What I Learned
- Working with different data types: numbers and booleans.
- Using comparison and logical operators.

### Exercises
1. Declared a number variable and assigned it a value.
2. Declared another number variable and assigned it a floating number.
3. Performed addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation with these numbers.
4. Compared two numbers using comparison operators and stored the results in boolean variables.
5. Used logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) with boolean variables.
6. Used assignment operators to modify a variable's value.

## Conditional Statements and Loops

### What I Learned
- Using `if-else` statements and `switch` statements to handle different conditions.
- Writing `for` loops to iterate over a range of numbers or array elements.

### Exercises
1. Checked the temperature and printed messages based on different temperature ranges using `if-else` statements and `switch` statements.
2. Checked if a number is divisible by 2, 3, or both using `if-else` statements and `switch` statements.
3. Printed numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
4. Printed all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a `for` loop.
5. Calculated the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop.
6. Printed each element of an array using a `for` loop.
7. Found and printed the largest number in an array using a `for` loop.

## While Loops

### What I Learned
- Using `while` loops for repeated execution based on a condition.

### Exercises
1. Printed numbers from 1 to 10 using a `while` loop.
2. Printed all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a `while` loop.
3. Calculated the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a `while` loop.
4. Printed all multiples of 5 less than 50 using a `while` loop.

### File
- [while_loops.js](./while_loops.js)

## Do While Loops

### What I Learned
- Using `do-while` loops for repeated execution, ensuring the loop runs at least once.

### Exercises
1. Printed numbers from 1 to 10 using a `do-while` loop.
2. Calculated the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 using a `do-while` loop.
3. Prompted the user to enter a number greater than 10, continuing to ask until a valid number was entered.
4. Created a simple guessing game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 10 until the correct number is guessed.
